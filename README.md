## Introduction
LearnABC is an App to help teach kids English Alphabets. 
It specially helps them to recognize different alphabets 
by prompting them to touch one letter out of a couple displayed on screen.

This is the first version, and pretty crude - no colors, no pretty graphics.
I hope to keep on building it on my spare time, and who knows, things might
look better sometime soon.

The primary motivation to develop this was a similar app on iOS which my
daughter liked a lot. She plays a lot with my wife's phone too, which runs
on BadaOS, a proprietary smartphone OS from Samsung.

I tried to find the iOS app or something similar on Bada's AppStore. But could
not find anything remotely related. So on one weekend I thought let me just build
it on my own. And here it is.

With all its crudeness and plain looks - my daughter like it a lot, specially so
because her dad's voice is in there. Which is very satisfying for me, to say the least.

## How to Build
To build the source code, first you need to download the BadaSDK from here: http://developer.bada.com/devtools/sdk
Next, follow the steps lister here: http://developer.bada.com/support-develop - which describes how to create an ApplicationID and create projects using existing source-code.
